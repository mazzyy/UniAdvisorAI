Entry with a four-year BSc Hons (or equivalent degree)EU degrees: Applicants with a four-year first class BSc Hons (Bachelor of Science with Honours) degree awarded by a university inside the European Bologna System (equivalent to 240 ECTS credits) are eligible to apply.
UK/Australia/Canada degrees: Applicants with a four-year first class BSc Hons or MSci degree (equivalent to 240 ECTS credits) from the UK, Australia or Canada are eligible to apply.
Depending on the specifics of your curriculum and your academic background, you may be assigned an additional course load of 15 to 60 ECTS credits by the Munich universities.

This includes BSc degrees awarded by universities from the USA, Asia, Africa and Turkey.
Medical degrees
Candidates with a medical degree such as a MBBS degree (or an equivalent degree) and medical students from Germany are not eligible to apply to our PhD programme. We recommend applying to specific MD/PhD programmes instead.
Likewise, candidates with a degree in veterinary medicine typically are not eligible to apply.
Recognising international degrees
Please keep in mind that your university needs to be recognised by the German authorities. This is the case for most European public and state universities and only very few private universities may not be recognised. If you apply from overseas, we recommend visiting the governmental anabin website that allows you to check whether your university and your degree programme are recognised in Germany.
A full assessment regarding eligibility is only possible after submission of a complete application and typically requires the approval of university officials.
It is not necessary to already hold the relevant degree at the time of application. However, accepted candidates need to hold their degree prior to starting their doctoral studies and enrolment at IMPRS-ML.
Should you have questions regarding eligibility that cannot be answered in this section, please get in touch with the IMPRS-ML Coordination Office.","Successful candidates need to be fluent in written and spoken English and, unless native speakers, should document their proficiency in English. Ideally, this can be achieved with a TOEFL report, an IELTS report or a Cambridge ESOL certificate (equivalent language tests are also accepted). If an English proficiency test cannot be provided, applicants should describe their English skills in the application form and explain why they think their English skills are sufficient to successfully complete doctoral studies at IMPRS-ML.
